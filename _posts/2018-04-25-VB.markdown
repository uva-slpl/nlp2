Hello everyone, 

I've prepared [some material](//uva-slpl.github.io/nlp2/resources/slides/ibm-vb.pdf) (also available from the syllabus page) on Variational Bayes for IBM1 for you.

I apologise for I did not show up last lab session (something that could not wait came up), but I will be there this Thursday (April 26) and will go through the slides with you. 

Best, 

W.
