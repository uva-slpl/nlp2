Hello everyone, 

I've prepared [some material](//uva-slpl.github.io/nlp2/resources/slides/ibm-vb.pdf) (also available from the syllabus page) on Variational Bayes for IBM1 for you.

I apologise for I did not show up last lab session (something that could not wait came up), but I will be there this Thursday (April 26) and will go through the slides with you. 

Best, 

W.


**After lecture** 

I've uploaded some notation on slide (14). If you want to learn more about VI and its connection to EM, check [Beal's thesis](//www.cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/mbeal/papers/beal03.pdf) and if you want to learn more about the ELBO you can also check a tutorial on [VI](//arxiv.org/pdf/1601.00670.pdf). By the way, I mentioned slides from unsupervised language learning, [this is it](//uva-slpl.github.io/ull/resources/slides/dgm.pdf).

Cheers, 

W.
