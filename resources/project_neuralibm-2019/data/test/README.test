TEST DATA FOR THE ENGLISH-FRENCH WORD ALIGNMENT TASK


Data
----
The test set for English-French contains 447 sentences. See the
"Guidelines" for details regarding the annotation scheme.
These sentences were extracted from a set of word aligned sentences
created by Prof.Hermann Ney and Franz Och.

File Naming Conventions
-----------------------
There is one set of files, with the English text carrying the .e extension,
and the French text carrying the .f extension. The file FilePairs.test 
includes the names of this file pair, with lines in the format:
<English_File_Name> <French_Text_File_Name>

Source and target language
-------------------------
For this task, English is the source language, and French is the target
language. Therefore, in a word alignment line:
sentence_no position_L1 position_L2 [S|P] [confidence]

position_L1 represents the position of the word within the English sentence, 
position_L2 represents the position of the word within the French sentence,

[the first word in a sentence is at position 1]

Other
-----
1. An alignment has to be provided for each word in the test files. If a word
does not appear in any alignment, we assume by default a P[robable] NULL 
alignment for that word.

2. Participants are required to submit one file with alignment results.
