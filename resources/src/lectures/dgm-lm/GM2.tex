%\caption{\label{fig:GM1}A graphical representation of our basic model. The outer plate represents a multilingual parallel corpus made of $S$ source sentences paired with translations into $n$ target languages. The model generates the source side of the data while conditioning on all $n$ target streams. Source sentences are generated one word at a time, and words are independent of one another given an alignment which selects a target position in each of the $n$ target streams.}
