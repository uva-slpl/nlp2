  abstract = 	 {We consider training probabilistic classifiers in the case that the number of classes is too large to perform exact normalisation over all classes.  We show that the source of high variance in standard sampling approximations is due to simply not including the correct class of the datapoint into the approximation. To account for this we explicitly sum over a subset of classes and sample the remaining. We show that this simple approach is competitive with recently introduced non likelihood-based approximations. }

  abstract = 	 {Recent advances in neural variational inference have spawned a renaissance in deep latent variable models. In this paper we introduce a generic variational inference framework for generative and conditional models of text. While traditional variational methods derive an analytic approximation for the intractable distributions over latent variables, here we construct an inference network conditioned on the discrete text input to provide the variational distribution. We validate this framework on two very different text modelling applications, generative document modelling and supervised question answering. Our neural variational document model combines a continuous stochastic document representation with a bag-of-words generative model and achieves the lowest reported perplexities on two standard test corpora. The neural answer selection model employs a stochastic representation layer within an attention mechanism to extract the semantics between a question and answer pair. On two question answering benchmarks this model exceeds all previous published benchmarks.}
