This project will help you 

In summary, your task is to

\begin{itemize}
	\item Implement 
\end{itemize}

\section{Neural Machine Translation}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item 
	\begin{enumerate}[a)]
		\item Implement 
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

%In your report, you should also consider the limitations of Model 1
%as described by \cite{Moore:2004:IBM1}, and find examples in your
%output to illustrate these limitations.



\section{Data}

All relevant data (including details about file formats) are available from \url{https://uva-slpl.github.io/nlp2/projects.html}.

In this project, you will work with a parallel corpus taken from 

We are making available \emph{training} data (which you can use to perform parameter estimation), \emph{validation} data (which you can use to debug your implementation as well as to perform model selection), and finally in due time \emph{test} data (which you will use to conduct your final empirical comparison).



\section{Report}

You should use latex for your report, and you should use the ACL template available from \url{http://acl2017.org/downloads/acl17-latex.zip} (unlike the template suggests, your submission should not be anonymous). 

We expect short reports (4 pages plus references) written in English. The typical submission is organised as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item abstract: conveys scope and contributions;
	\item introduction: present the problem and relevant background;
	\item model: technical description of models;
	\item experiments: details about the data, experimental setup and findings;
	\item conclusion: a critical take on contributions and limitations.
\end{itemize}


\section{Submission}

You should submit a tgz file containing a folder (folder name {\tt lastname1.lastname2}) with the following content: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item Test predictions (in naacl format) using your best run for each of the following models
	\begin{itemize}
		\item 
	\end{itemize}
	\item Report as a single pdf file (filename: {\tt report.pdf})
\end{itemize}

Your report may contain a link to an open-source repository (such as github), but please do not attach code or additional data to your tgz submission.

You can complete your project submission on Blackboard.

%You should email your tgz file to \url{J.C.P.Bastings@uva.nl} no later than {\bf 23:59 GMT-8 on April 26}. If you do not get a confirmation email within 24h after submission, please make sure to contact one of us.

\section{Assessment}

Your report will be assessed by two independent reviewers according to the following evaluation criteria:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Scope (max 2 points): Is the problem well presented? Do students understand the challenges/contributions?
	\item Theoretical description (max 3 points): Are the models presented clearly and correctly?
	\item Empirical evaluation (max 3 points): Is the experimental setup sound/convincing? Are experimental findings presented in an organised and effective manner? 
	\item Writing style (max 2 points): use of latex, structure of report, use of tables/figures/plots, command of English.	
	\item Extra.
\end{enumerate}
