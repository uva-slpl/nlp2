  title: "Variational auto-encoders"
  instructor: Wilker Aziz
  abstract:  "In this lecture I will present generative modelling with neural networks, we will start with a mixture model and then present the variational auto-encoder."
  background:

    - "Chapter 2 of Matthew Beal's [PhD thesis](http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/faculty/mbeal/papers/beal03.pdf) gives a very clear development of variational inference for Bayesian models."
