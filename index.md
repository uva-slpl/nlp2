This is the main page of the course *Natural Language Processing 2* offered at the [University of Amsterdam][UvA].

# Content 

This course, which builds on NLP I, is about statistical learning for structure prediction problems. 
We will concentrate on *machine translation* as a good example of an NLP problem that encompasses a wide set of computational linguistic tasks such as parsing, morphology and semantics. 

# Format

This is a research-oriented course where we have lectures, discussion sessions led by students, labs, and project assignments.
We supply reading material (either research papers or tutorials) for lectures as well as a list of pointers for further reading.


## Discussion sessions

A group (**3 members**) selects a paper to be discussed. Then

1. Everyone reads the chosen paper before the session
2. The selected group gives a talk presenting the work to the rest of the class: you can decide how to organise your talk (whether everyone presents, or just one presents is entirely up to you)
3. Everyone participates in an open discussion 


# Projects

We will have 2 project assignments: students work in groups (**3 members**). Projects will be assessed on the basis of technical reports.


# Grades 

[Weighted geometric mean](//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weighted_geometric_mean) of the grades for presentation (10%) and project work (45%/45%).
