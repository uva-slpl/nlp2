This is the main page of the course *Natural Language Processing 2* offered at the [University of Amsterdam][UvA].

# Content 

This course, which builds on NLP I, is about statistical learning for structure prediction problems. 
We will concentrate on *machine translation* as a good example of an NLP problem that encompasses a wide set of computational linguistic tasks such as parsing, morphology and semantics. 

# Format

This is a research-oriented course where we have lectures, labs, and project assignments.
We supply reading material (either research papers or tutorials) for lectures as well as a list of pointers for further reading.


# Projects

We will have 2 project assignments: students work in groups (**3 members**). Projects will be assessed on the basis of technical reports.


# Grades 

The grades are: **project 1** 50%  and **project 2** 50%.
